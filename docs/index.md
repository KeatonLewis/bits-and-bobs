# Bits and Bobs!

Bits and Bobs is a simple repo that I intend to use for aggregation of side projects, silly ideas, and github pages experiments.
Below you should see links to these types of things assuming I ever got around to doing any of that. If you don't, please don't hold it against me.
After all, who hasn't had a plethora of side projects fall off of one truck or another along the quest of development. C'est la vie.
